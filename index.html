					In the past year, New Yorkers have seen restaurants go through ups and downs during the pandemic with some establishments having to close and others expanding to the streets.

				</p>

				<p class="information-paragraph-2">

					With New York “slowly reopening,” restaurants are finally able to go from take-out to outdoor dining as well as re-introduce indoor dining, with some restrictions. To help keep their business afloat, many restaurants implemented outdoor dining. 

				</p>	

				<p class="information-paragraph-3">

					According to the New York City Department of Transportation, “establishments seeking to utilize additional public sidewalk or roadway space for outdoor dining operations must apply online at 

					<a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pedestrians/openrestaurants.shtml"> nyc.gov/openrestaurants</a> 

					and may commence upon self-certification.” 

				</p>	

				<p class="information-paragraph-4">

					The Department of Transportation opened their Open Restaurant Application in June 2020, in efforts to help the restaurant industry. This free application is for food service establishments seeking authorization to re-open under Phase Two of the State’s New York Forward Plan. Restaurants that utilize any privately owned outdoor space, such as front yards or courtyards, private parking lots, balconies, terraces, open air rooftop space, or open air boats do not need approval from the Department of Transportation.

				</p>	

				<p class="information-paragraph-5"> 

					It is specifically for restaurants to apply for sidewalk access, roadway access, or both.

				<p class="information-paragraph-6">

					Of the 7,939 restaurants that applied for outdoor dining, most applied for both sidewalk and roadway access.

				</p>

				<p class="information-paragraph-7">

					In the height of the pandemic, many organizations were formed in favor of the restaurant industry. Founded in March 2020, ROAR (Restaurants Organizing, Advocating & Rebuilding) fights "for unemployed restaurant workers facing financial hardship and to advocate for an industry in crisis,” according to their 

					<a href="https://www.roarnewyork.org/"> website</a>.

				</p>

				<p class="information-paragraph-8">

					This organization was also instrumental in helping restaurants obtain outdoor dining.  

				</p>

				<p class="information-paragraph-9">

					“We made sure that outdoor dining was made permanent, which meant that restaurants were going to be able to employ their restaurant workers for the winter,” says Andrea Strong, the executive director of ROARny. “Otherwise, hundreds of thousands of more people would have been unemployed again if it hadn’t been for outdoor dining.” 

				</p>

				<p class="information-paragraph-10">

					Applying for outdoor dining access allowed restaurants to have more than just take-out and delivery options. However, this added establishment takes up space. The application detailed the square feet of how much the restaurant is applying for.

				<p class="information-paragraph-11">

					Throughout all five boroughs, Manhattan had the most applied for square footage with 1.93 million square feet. The Bronx and Staten Island are at the bottom with less than 400,000 square feet. 

				</p>

				<p class="information-paragraph-12">

					The Department of Transportation has been reached multiple times and have not responded. 

				</p>

				<p class="information-paragraph-13">

					The Department of Transportation is now looking towards making outdoor dining permanent by 2023. 

				</p>

				<p class="information-paragraph-14">

					According to their 

					<a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pedestrians/openrestaurants.shtml"> website</a>, 

					they plan to continue to administer Open Restaurant Applications citywide. By Fall 2022, their timeline aims to have all legal actions take place from changes to local laws to rulemaking to city design. Ending with their permanent program application launching by Winter 2022.
